## Data

When the user enters a subscriber number the profile page gets rendered and a fetch request gets send with each isbn number of the books rented by the user. 

For the live version i made a mock up of the data. If you want to try it out you can login with number: 1, 2 or 3. The number has to be typed in the username and password input.
