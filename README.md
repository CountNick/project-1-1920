## Concept

Oba data editor is a user profile where people can change or remove the information they have previously shared with OBA, check their reading behaviour, check rented books and get reading recomendations according to genre.

## Data

### __Data__

* Oba excell datasheet with user data(not published), the file in this project is a [mockup](https://github.com/CountNick/project-1-1920/blob/master/fakeSet.json)

* The valid ISBN numbers get filtered out of the excel dataset and a fetch request to the OBA api gets send with these numbers

### How the data flow works: 

When the user enters his or her subscriber number the profile page gets rendered and a fetch request gets send with each isbn number of the books rented by the user. When the user clicks on one of the previously rented books a detailpage of said book gets rendered and a new fetch to the API is done with the genre of the book that has been clicked.

For the live version i made a mock up of the data. If you want to try it out you can login with number: 1, 2 or 3. The number has to be typed in the username and password input.

## Wishlist

Things i wanted to do but didn't have any time for

* Data visualisations
    * Reading behaviour
    * How many males / females are interested in your favorite genre
    * How many people from your postal code are interested in the same genre 

* Detail page for each recommended books

* Make data changeble

* Render appropriate color schemes in profile according to age of user

## Initial ideas

Search engine for kids' books based on user input:

* Choose a subject
* Enter your age
* Show suited books for kid based on the given input

## Installation 

Installation

__*Note in order to run this project locally you need some kind of local server to start it up. I used the liveServer extension in VS Code*__

Open up terminal, and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/CountNick/project-1-1920.git
```
```
cd project-1-1920
```
Open up the folder in VS code and start live server. The app will now be running on localhost:5500
